        <p>

            The agricultural sector uses over 70â€‰% of global freshwater withdrawals for irrigation. The projected increase in global mean 
            temperature, population growth and changing precipitation patterns are expected to decrease natural water availability in already-water-scarce regions of the world.
            Hence, it is essential that water is used efficiently and effectively to prevent the exacerbation of this <span style="color: red;">global looming threat.</span>

          This Web App allows you to calculate your Irrigation Needs for various crops, through various stages of growth, and also by considering
            your location: precipitation, mean temperature and so on.. <br> <br>
       <p style="font-size: smaller;"> <i>   P.S: This is in development stage and so at this point of time gives you information for only 5 states in the US (The largest Agricultural producers:
